# Prompt steps

1. Paste the content of init-instructions.md to the prompt.
2. When done reading, paste this:

- Read through all files in the project and confirm that you've understood what's going on. However, NEVER read or reference files in the _private/ directory.
- The project workflow isn't done yet, you will help me finish it.
- After completing ANY changes (initial work, fixes, or improvements), ALWAYS update the CHANGELOG with current date and commit the changes (pattern: <type>[optional scope]: <what changed> (<optional why/context>), < 72 chars). Treat every modification as a "logically distinct unit of work" requiring documentation.
