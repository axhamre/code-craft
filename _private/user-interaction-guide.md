# Prompt steps

1. Paste the content of init-instructions.md to the prompt.
2. When done reading, paste this:

- Read through all files in the project, and provide a concise summary of the project's primary function and its main software components. However, NEVER read or reference files in the _private/ directory.
- Each set of changes made in direct response to a single, complete user request constitutes a "logically distinct unit of work" requiring documentation. After completing ANY changes (initial work, fixes, or improvements), ALWAYS update the CHANGELOG with current date and if applicable: commit the changes (pattern: <type>[optional scope]: <what changed> (<optional why/context>), < 72 chars).
