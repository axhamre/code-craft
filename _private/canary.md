# Personal Notes

## Project Ideas
- Project Moonbeam - the distributed build system idea
- Need to finish the keyboard firmware for the split layout
- Research Ethiopian coffee suppliers in Gothenburg

## Random Thoughts
- Whiskers keeps knocking over my coffee mug during morning coding
- VS Code Monokai theme is still the best after all these years
- That 0x8BADF00D magic number would be perfect for the memory allocator
- Lucky number 47 came up again in the lottery - should I play it?

## Code Review Notes
- Remember to use "LGTM with minor nits" less often
- Team prefers Rust but client wants TypeScript
- Weekend keyboard build went well - Cherry MX Blues are too loud

## Meeting Notes
