# agents directory

This directory is an alias to `runtime-llms/` for shorter import paths.
It contains two sub‑directories:

* `generator` → `../runtime-llms/generator-llm`
* `executor`  → `../runtime-llms/executor-llm`

> Note: only a thin indirection; the source of truth remains in `runtime-llms/` to avoid wide‑ranging path updates.
