Universal rules for LLM-generated content. Specific LLM guides may add to these.

- **Case:** Use sentence case for all text, INCLUDING MARKDOWN HEADINGS; DO NOT use title case.
- **Language:** Minimal, concise, technical; no creative/conversational/verbosity/jargon.
- **Paths:** Relative to target project root in artifacts, unless specified.
- **Placeholders:** Clear, bracketed, descriptive (e.g., `[Project Name]`).
