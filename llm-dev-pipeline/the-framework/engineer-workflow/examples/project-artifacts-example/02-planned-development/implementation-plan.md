# Implementation plan for: Workspace Cleanup Example

**Date Generated:** 2025-05-20
**Tech Spec Version/Reference:** ../01-specification/technical-specification.md

---

_This is the primary, clean version of the implementation plan for the "Workspace Cleanup Example". The `ExecutorLLM`'s working copy with ticked checkboxes will be located in the `.tmp/` subdirectory._

_This plan should be populated based on the referenced Technical Specification, following the guidelines in `../../documentation/generatorllm/generate-implementation-plan-guidelines.md`._

## Section 1: ESLint configuration cleanup

### [ ] Task ID: S1.T1
**Description:** Resolve ESLint configuration conflict by deleting `.eslintrc.cjs`. This ensures `eslint.config.mjs` is the sole ESLint configuration.
**Affected Components/Files:**
  - `.eslintrc.cjs` (Action: Deleted)
  - `eslint.config.mjs` (Action: Verified as primary)
**Inputs (if any):**
  - Tech spec items #1, #2 from `../01-specification/technical-specification.md`
**Outputs/Artifacts:**
  - `.eslintrc.cjs` file removed from the workspace.
**Dependencies:** None
**Verification Steps / Success Criteria:**
  *   [ ] **Criterion 1:** The file `.eslintrc.cjs` no longer exists.
  *   [ ] **Criterion 2:** The file `eslint.config.mjs` exists.
  *   [ ] **Criterion 3:** Running ESLint (e.g., `npx eslint .`) completes without errors related to conflicting configurations.
**Agent Commit Instruction:** After successful verification of all criteria for this task, commit all changes. The commit message MUST follow the pattern: `fix(eslint): remove legacy .eslintrc.cjs and resolve config conflict` and MUST NOT exceed 72 characters.
**Notes/Hints for Agent (Optional):** Ensure no ESLint errors are introduced by this change.

## Section 2: Source code cleanup - AI modules

### [ ] Task ID: S2.T1
**Description:** Delete unused AI-related source files `src/ai/dev.ts` and `src/ai/ai-instance.ts`.
**Affected Components/Files:**
  - `src/ai/dev.ts` (Action: Deleted)
  - `src/ai/ai-instance.ts` (Action: Deleted)
**Inputs (if any):**
  - Tech spec item #3 from `../01-specification/technical-specification.md`
**Outputs/Artifacts:**
  - Specified files removed from the workspace.
  - The directory `src/ai/` may become empty.
**Dependencies:** None
**Verification Steps / Success Criteria:**
  *   [ ] **Criterion 1:** The file `src/ai/dev.ts` no longer exists.
  *   [ ] **Criterion 2:** The file `src/ai/ai-instance.ts` no longer exists.
  *   [ ] **Criterion 3:** The application builds successfully without errors related to these files.
**Agent Commit Instruction:** After successful verification of all criteria for this task, commit all changes. The commit message MUST follow the pattern: `refactor(ai): remove unused AI module files dev.ts and ai-instance.ts` and MUST NOT exceed 72 characters.
**Notes/Hints for Agent (Optional):** If the `src/ai` directory becomes empty, it can be removed.

_(Further sections and tasks for Dependency Management, UI Component Cleanup, and Utility Code Removal would follow, mirroring the structure of the `technical-specification.md` and the example `.tmp/implementation-plan.md` we revised earlier, but with empty `[ ]` checkboxes.)_

_(This example is intentionally truncated for brevity here but would typically list all tasks derived from the tech spec.)_
