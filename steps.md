# Prompt steps

1. Paste the content of init-instructions.md to the prompt.
2. When done reading, paste this:

- Read through all files in the project and confirm that you've understood what's going on.
- The project workflow isn't done yet, you will help me finish it.
- Commit you changes (pattern: <type>[optional scope]: <what changed> (<optional why/context>), < 72 chars) and update the CHANGELOG file after each logically distinct unit of work is implemented.
