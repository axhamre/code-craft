# Technical specification for: Simple todo application

**Date:** 2025-05-25
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Project overview
Build a lightweight, single-page todo application using vanilla web technologies. The app allows users to manage a personal task list with persistence via browser localStorage. Focus on simplicity, speed, and cross-browser compatibility.

## Functional requirements

### Core features
- **Task creation:** Users can add new tasks via text input field
- **Task completion:** Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete using checkboxes
- **Task deletion:** Users can permanently remove tasks with delete buttons
- **Task persistence:** All tasks are automatically saved to localStorage and restored on page load
- **Task counting:** Display total tasks and completed task count

### User interactions
- **Add task:** Enter text in input field, press Enter or click Add button
- **Toggle completion:** Click checkbox next to task to toggle complete/incomplete state
- **Delete task:** Click delete button (Ã—) to remove task permanently
- **Visual feedback:** Completed tasks show strikethrough text and muted colors

## Technical requirements

### Architecture
- **Single HTML file:** `index.html` contains all markup structure
- **Single CSS file:** `styles.css` handles all visual styling and responsive layout
- **Single JavaScript file:** `app.js` manages all functionality and localStorage operations
- **No external dependencies:** Pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript only

### Data models
- **Task object:** `{id: string, text: string, completed: boolean, createdAt: timestamp}`
- **Tasks array:** Array of task objects stored in localStorage as JSON
- **Storage key:** Use `'todoApp_tasks'` as localStorage key for consistency

### APIs/interfaces
- **localStorage API:** For data persistence (getItem, setItem)
- **DOM API:** For UI manipulation (querySelector, addEventListener, createElement)
- **Event handlers:** Input changes, button clicks, form submissions

## Non-functional requirements
- **Performance:** Page loads completely in under 2 seconds on standard broadband
- **Storage:** Handle up to 1000 tasks without performance degradation
- **Responsiveness:** Usable on mobile devices (320px width minimum)
- **Compatibility:** Works in Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+

## Assumptions and constraints

### Assumptions
- Users have JavaScript enabled in their browser
- Users understand basic todo list functionality
- LocalStorage is available and has sufficient space (5MB minimum)

### Constraints
- No server-side functionality required
- No user authentication or multi-user support
- Single browser/device usage only (no sync across devices)
- Maximum task text length: 500 characters

## Success criteria
- All tasks persist correctly after browser refresh
- Interface remains responsive on mobile screens (320px - 768px)
- Page loads completely in under 2 seconds
- Zero JavaScript errors in browser console
- Visual design is clean and professional
- Accessibility score of 95+ in Lighthouse audit
